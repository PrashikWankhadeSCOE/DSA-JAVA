/*
7. Special Stack
    Design a data-structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(),
    pop(), isEmpty(), isFull() and an additional operation getMin() which should return
    minimum element from the SpecialStack. Your task is to complete all the functions, using
    stack data-Structure.
    
    Example 1:
    Input:
      Stack: 18 19 29 15 16
    Output: 15
    Explanation:
      The minimum element of the stack is 15.
      Note: The output of the code will be the value returned by getMin() function.
      Expected Time Complexity: O(N) for getMin, O(1) for remaining all 4 functions.
      Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) for all the 5 functions.
    Constraints:
      1 ≤ N ≤ 104
