/*
14. Insert an Element at the Bottom of a Stack
    You are given a stack St of N integers and an element X. You have to insert X at the
    bottom of the given stack.
    
    Example 1:
    Input:
      N = 5
      X = 2
      St = {4,3,2,1,8}
    Output:
      {2,4,3,2,1,8}
    Explanation:
      After insertion of 2, the final stack will be {2,4,3,2,1,8}.
    
    Example 2:
    Input:
      N = 3
      X = 4
      St = {5,3,1}
    Output:
      {4,5,3,1}
    Explanation:
      After insertion of 4, the final stack will be {4,5,3,1}.
    Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
    Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
    
    Constraints:
      1 <= N <= 105
      1 <= X, Elements of Stack <= 103
      Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceeds 106
