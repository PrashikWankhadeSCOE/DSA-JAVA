15. Sort a stack
    Given a stack, the task is to sort it such that the top of the stack has the greatest element.
    
    Example 1:
    Input:
      Stack: 3 2 1
    Output: 3 2 1
    
    Example 2:
    Input:
      Stack: 11 2 32 3 41
    Output: 41 32 11 3 2
    
    Expected Time Complexity: O(N*N)
    Expected Auxilliary Space: O(N) recursive.
    
    Constraints:
      1<=N<=100
