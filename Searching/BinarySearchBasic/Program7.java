/*
 * Given a sorted binary array consisting of only 0s and 1s, write a program to count
 * the number of 1s in the array using binary search.
 * For example, given the input array arr = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the function should
 * return 5 as there are five occurrences of the digit 1 in the array.
