/*
 * Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given
 * target value.
 * Write a program to find the range of the target element in the array.
 * For example, given the array [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and the target element 8, the
 * function should return [3, 4], as 8 appears at positions 3 and 4 in the array.
