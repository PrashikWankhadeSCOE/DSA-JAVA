/*
 * Write a program to find the index where a given target element should be inserted
 * in a sorted array to maintain the array's sorted order.
 * For example, given the input array sortedArray = [1, 3, 5, 6] and the target element
 * 5, the function should return 2, as 5 is already present at index 2. If the target
 * element is 2, the function should return 1, as inserting 2 at index 1 would maintain
 * the sorted order.
